# LLM Prompt: Generate CyTOF Standard Slide Deck

Use this prompt verbatim (or paste into Claude / GPT-4) to generate a
python-pptx script that builds the slide deck.

---

## PROMPT START

You are an expert in Python and python-pptx. Generate a complete, runnable Python script
that builds a PowerPoint slide deck called `CyTOF_Standard_Overview.pptx`.

The deck is for a lab presentation introducing the `cytofstandard` analysis package
to a mixed audience of wet-lab biologists and computational analysts.
Tone: clear, professional, scientific. No filler slides.

### Design specifications

### Slide outline

Generate exactly the slides listed below, in this order.
For each slide, the content is specified. Implement it faithfully.

---

**Slide 1 — Title slide**
- Title: "CyTOF Standard Analysis Package"
- Subtitle: "Reproducible CyTOF analysis from submission to statistics"
- Footer (small): "cytofstandard · Lab internal · 2026"
- Layout: navy full-width header bar, white lower area

---

**Slide 2 — Agenda**
- Title: "What this deck covers"
- Two-column layout:
  - Left column header "For wet-lab users":
    - Why we switched to standardized analysis
    - What to submit after each CyTOF run
    - Folder structure and metadata rules
    - Submission checklist
  - Right column header "For analysis users":
    - Package architecture and data model
    - Full analysis workflow (API walkthrough)
    - Embedding, clustering, statistics
    - Export and reproducibility

---

**Slide 3 — Section divider**
- Navy background
- Large text: "Part 1"
- Subtitle: "Why we use cytofstandard"

---

**Slide 4 — The problem with the old workflow**
- Title: "The old workflow had hidden costs"
- Bullet points (use ✗ prefix, red-ish color #C00000):
  - Marker names differed across runs (H3K27Ac vs H3K27ac vs H3K27ac_168Er)
  - No permanent cell IDs — reanalysis could not match cells across sessions
  - Run-specific scripts made comparisons fragile
  - Sample/line linkage stored in filenames or analyst memory
  - No standardized processing log

---

**Slide 5 — What cytofstandard solves**
- Title: "cytofstandard: five core guarantees"
- Five rows in a clean table (2 columns: "Guarantee" | "What it means"):
  1. Permanent cell IDs | Every cell gets a UUID fixed at ingestion. Reanalysis finds the same cells.
  2. Standardized marker names | Alternate names mapped to lab standard at ingestion. No silent mismatches.
  3. Run-first analysis | Each run analyzed independently before any cross-run integration.
  4. Explicit sample → line linking | Every cell is traceable to its sample and biological line.
  5. Full provenance log | Every processing step (normalization, z-score, clustering) is recorded with parameters and version.

---

**Slide 6 — Section divider**
- Navy background
- Large text: "Part 2"
- Subtitle: "Data submission (wet-lab users)"

---

**Slide 7 — What to submit**
- Title: "For every CyTOF run, submit two things"
- Two large numbered items (big bold numerals):
  1. Debarcoded data files (FCS, CSV, or Parquet) — after preliminary QC by the CyTOF unit
  2. sample_metadata.csv — one row per submitted file, with file_name, sample_id, line_id
- Note box (yellow/green): "Do not submit pre-debarcoding multiplexed files."

---

**Slide 8 — Folder structure**
- Title: "Required folder structure"
- Code block (monospace):
```
run_2026_05_15/
    data_files/
        S001_MCF7_control_rep1.fcs
        S002_MCF7_treated_rep1.fcs
        S003_T47D_control_rep1.fcs
    sample_metadata.csv
```
- Short note below: "One folder per run. Do not rename files after creating the metadata."

---

**Slide 9 — sample_metadata.csv — required columns**
- Title: "sample_metadata.csv — required columns"
- Table (3 columns: Column | Required? | Meaning):
  - file_name | Yes | Exact filename. Case-sensitive. Include extension.
  - sample_id | Yes | Unique sample identifier for this run.
  - line_id   | Yes | Biological line or group (e.g. MCF7, T47D).
- Below table: "Recommended: condition, replicate_id, batch_id, acquisition_order, barcoding_id, notes"
- Code block (small example):
```
file_name,sample_id,line_id,condition,replicate_id
S001_MCF7_control_rep1.fcs,S001,MCF7,control,rep1
S002_T47D_treated_rep1.fcs,S002,T47D,treated,rep1
```

---

**Slide 10 — Metadata rules (the critical ones)**
- Title: "Four rules you must follow"
- Four bullet points with bold rule name followed by brief explanation:
  - Every submitted file must appear exactly once — if a file is missing from the metadata, ingestion stops.
  - File names must match exactly — case-sensitive, with extension. sample_A.fcs ≠ Sample_A.fcs
  - Each file maps to one sample and one line — duplicate rows for the same file with different lines will fail.
  - Use consistent spelling — MCF7 and MCF-7 are treated as different lines.

---

**Slide 11 — Marker names**
- Title: "Marker name standardization"
- Left side (60%): explanation paragraph:
  "The package maps common alternate names to the lab standard at ingestion.
   Use standard names whenever possible. The package recognizes these alternates:"
- Right side (40%): small 2-column table (Alternate → Standard):
  H3K27Ac → H3K27ac
  H3K9Ac → H3K9ac
  E-cad → E-cadherin
  PanKRT → Pan-KRT
  DNA1 → DNA
  DNA2 → DNA
- Warning box (orange): "Two DNA channels (DNA1 + DNA2) in the same file may clash. Notify the analysis person before ingestion."

---

**Slide 12 — Submission checklist**
- Title: "Submission checklist"
- Two-column checklist layout, checkboxes (☐):
  Left column:
  - ☐ Debarcoded files, post-QC
  - ☐ All files in data_files/
  - ☐ Metadata named sample_metadata.csv
  - ☐ Every file appears once in metadata
  - ☐ Each file → one sample_id, one line_id
  Right column:
  - ☐ file_name matches exactly (case, extension)
  - ☐ sample_id and line_id filled for all rows
  - ☐ Consistent spelling of lines and conditions
  - ☐ Acquisition order included if known
  - ☐ Problems noted in notes column

  MetadataValidationError: file not in metadata | Check file_name exact match (case + extension)
  MarkerValidationError: unknown markers | Use allow_extra_markers=True or add to marker_aliases.yaml
  Markers differ across files | Set common_markers_only=True to keep the intersection
  UMAP biased by group size imbalance | Use compute_umap_balanced() with n_per_group
  Dense boxplots / slow plotting | Use show_points=False; subset first with create_subset_run()

---

**Slide 28 — Summary**
- Title: "Summary"
- Two-column layout:
  Left — "For wet-lab users":
  - Submit debarcoded FCS / CSV / Parquet files
  - Include sample_metadata.csv with file_name, sample_id, line_id
  - Follow naming and spelling rules exactly
  - Use the submission checklist before handing off
  Right — "For analysis users":
  - Project → add_run → ingest → QC → normalize → zscore → UMAP → cluster → PermCell → plot
  - All data stored in AnnData/Zarr with full provenance
  - Every cell has a permanent UUID traceable to source file and event index
  - Raw data is never overwritten; all processing stages retained as named layers

---

### python-pptx implementation notes

- Use `python-pptx` only (no external dependencies beyond `Pillow` for any image work).
- Section divider slides: set slide background fill to navy #1F3864.
- Content slide layout: use blank layout (index 6), position all elements manually with `Inches()` / `Cm()`.
- For the code blocks: add a rectangle shape with light gray fill (#F2F2F2), no line, add a text frame inside using Courier New 10pt, preserve leading whitespace using spaces (not tabs).
- For tables: use `add_table`, shade header row with steel blue #2E75B6 fill, white bold text.
- For the note/warning boxes: rectangle shape with fill color, no border, italic text inside.
- For the ASCII diagram on slide 14: place in a text box with Courier New 9pt, light gray background box behind it.
- The script should be self-contained and runnable with `python3 build_slide_deck.py`.
- Save the output as `CyTOF_Standard_Overview.pptx` in the current directory.
- Print a summary at the end: number of slides written and output path.
