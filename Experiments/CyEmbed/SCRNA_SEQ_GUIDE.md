# Running CyEmbed on scRNA-seq

CyEmbed was written for CyTOF. This guide covers what changes when you point it at single-cell
RNA-seq instead — which settings become mandatory, which become dangerous, and how to tell
whether the archetypes you get back are biology or artifact.

Companion documents: `CODEBASE_DESCRIPTION.md` for the full API, and
`../mcRBM/Desc/scrna_seq_guide.md` for the same treatment of mcRBM.

## 1. Orientation: "marker" means "gene"

The package says `marker_names`, `MarkerScaler`, `num_markers` everywhere. On scRNA-seq every one
of those means *gene*. Nothing needs renaming — just read it that way.

Three differences drive everything else in this guide:

| | CyTOF | scRNA-seq |
|---|---|---|
| Features | ~40 markers | 1,000–3,000 HVGs |
| Measurement | continuous ion counts | integer UMI counts |
| Zeros | rare | most of the matrix |

The last one is the important one. A zero in CyTOF means "not expressed." A zero in scRNA-seq
might mean that, or it might mean the transcript was there and simply wasn't captured. CyEmbed's
reconstruction loss is MSE or Huber (`losses.py:17-20`) — a Gaussian likelihood with constant
variance — which has no way to represent that ambiguity and no idea that a gene's variance grows
with its mean.

**The fix is entirely upstream.** Feed CyEmbed SCTransform Pearson residuals and MSE stops being
wrong: residuals are approximately homoscedastic, which is precisely the regime where a constant-
variance Gaussian is the correct likelihood. Everything below assumes you have done that.

One thing the package will not do for you: **feature selection**. Subset to HVGs before you call
`extract_matrix`. There is no gene filtering anywhere in CyEmbed.

---

## 2. Getting data in

The residual h5ads produced by
`../ProbAE_Deconv/notebooks/experiment_suite/300_scrna_sct_gaussian_k_sweep.ipynb` have a simple
shape, and CyEmbed reads them directly:

- Residuals live in **`X`** — dense float32. No layers, no `obsm`.
- `var` is indexed by gene symbol, carrying `residual_variance` as provenance.
- `obs` contains **`cell_id` and nothing else**.

```python
import anndata as ad
from CyEmbed.data import extract_matrix

adata = ad.read_h5ad("../ProbAE_Deconv/data/PDX_02_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad")

bundle = extract_matrix(adata=adata, source="X")
# bundle.X            -> (5774, 1000) float32
# bundle.marker_names -> gene symbols, from adata.var_names
# bundle.cell_ids     -> barcodes, from adata.obs_names
```

`extract_matrix` is keyword-only (`data.py:103`). `source` accepts `"X"`, `"layer"` (requires
`layer=`), or `"obsm"` (requires `obsm_key=`). Sparse input is densified automatically by
`_to_numpy` (`data.py:10`), so a CSR `.X` works without ceremony.

Note the import style: the real notebooks import from submodules (`from CyEmbed.data import ...`)
rather than the top-level package. Several functions you will want — `balanced_downsample_indices`,
`purity_summary` — are not in `__init__.py`'s `__all__` and are only reachable that way.

---

## 3. The one setting you must change

```python
scaler, fit_idx = fit_scaler(bundle.X, mode="none")
X = preprocess_array(bundle.X, scaler)
```

**`mode="none"`.** Not `"zscore"`. SCT Pearson residuals are already centred and variance-
stabilised per gene — the source h5ad measures `mean = -0.0000, std = 0.9858`. Z-scoring on top
undoes the stabilisation you paid for, rescaling each gene by a standard deviation that
SCTransform already normalised away.

This is why the existing sweep config sets `transform: "none"` and `normalization: "none"` with
the comment *"SCT Pearson residuals are already ~N(0,1) per gene."* Follow it.

### Which Pearson residuals? SCTransform and the analytic form are not the same thing

"Pearson residuals" covers two transforms that are routinely spoken of interchangeably:

- **SCTransform** (Hafemeister & Satija 2019) — per-gene `theta` from regularized NB regression,
  kernel-smoothed across genes. Seurat's `SCT` `scale.data`.
- **Analytic Pearson residuals** (Lause/Berens/Kobak 2021) — closed form with a single fixed
  `theta` (usually 100). Much faster, and the paper argues it matches or beats the regularized
  fit.

They also differ in a detail that is easy to miss and matters here: **clip range**. Since
CyEmbed's loss is MSE, large residuals dominate the gradient, so the clip changes which genes get
to define archetypes — when two routes disagree, suspect the clip before the `theta` estimator.

**The clip is an entry-point choice, not a property of SCTransform.** Verified against
`sctransform` 0.4.2:

| entry point | default `res_clip_range` |
|---|---|
| `sctransform::vst` | `c(-sqrt(ncol(umi)), sqrt(ncol(umi)))` — i.e. `sqrt(N)` |
| Seurat `SCTransform` wrapper | `sqrt(N/30)` |
| analytic convention (Lause et al.) | `sqrt(N)` |

So `vst` called directly clips the *same* way as the analytic route, and only the Seurat wrapper
tightens it. `BCK_44_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad` maxes at 3.76, consistent with the wrapper
running on ~424 cells (`sqrt(424/30) = 3.76`) before the tumour-only subset to 330.

**Measured on BCK_44** (`01_bck44_scrna_archetype_embedding_sweep.ipynb`, K ∈ {3..8} × 3 seeds,
both routes), SCTransform won clearly:

| | analytic (`theta=100`) | SCTransform |
|---|---|---|
| worst archetype-vs-depth correlation | −0.300 | **−0.092** |
| gene modules across seeds | 0.488 | **0.812** |
| `val_recon` sd across seeds | 0.011–0.109 | **0.002–0.039** |
| mean entropy(W) at K=7 | 0.683 | **1.297** (max 1.946) |
| cells hard-assigned (w > 0.8) | 35.5% | **9.1%** |

Two of those are close to disqualifying for the analytic route on this dataset. The depth
artifact is the serious one — a fixed `theta = 100` left the *highest-usage* archetype tracking
library size, with a plausible-looking gene list. And 35.5% of cells hard-assigned means the
analytic route was degenerating toward hard clustering, discarding the between-vertex mixing
that is the point of archetypal analysis.

**Caveat: confounded four ways** on this data — `theta`, clip, cell set (352 vs 330), and gene
set (2000 vs 1000) all differ, and the SCT cells are tumour-only and so more homogeneous. This
does not isolate SCTransform as the cause. But every difference points the same way and the
depth result is what theory predicts.

**Recommendation: use SCTransform residuals when you have them.** Reach for the analytic form
when you need to compute residuals from counts inside the pipeline, want all your HVGs rather
than an upstream subset, or have no Seurat output — and when you do, run the depth diagnostic
below before trusting any archetype.

### `robust_zscore` is broken on sparse data — do not use it

This one will bite hard and it is worth understanding rather than just avoiding.

```python
# data.py:63-70
elif self.mode == "robust_zscore":
    center = np.median(x, axis=0)
    mad = np.median(np.abs(x - center[None, :]), axis=0)
    scale = 1.4826 * mad
...
scale = np.maximum(scale, self.eps)   # eps = 1e-8
```

For any gene detected in **under 50% of cells** — which is most genes — the median is 0. Then
`|x - 0| = |x|`, whose median is *also* 0. MAD is zero, `scale` clamps to `1e-8`, and every
detected value gets multiplied by roughly 1e8.

You will not get silently wrong numbers; `train.py`'s non-finite guards raise `FloatingPointError`
after the first step. But the mode is simply unusable here, and the error message will not tell you
why. If you are working on raw or log1p data rather than residuals, this is the trap.

---

## 4. Turn off the residual latent

```python
"use_residual_latent": False
```

`ProbabilisticArchetypeModel` can give each cell a private residual latent that absorbs whatever
the archetypes cannot explain. On CyTOF that is useful. On scRNA-seq, "whatever the archetypes
cannot explain" is largely dropout noise, and handing it a dedicated place to live defeats the
main thing protecting you.

That protection is worth naming, because it is CyEmbed's real advantage on sparse data: the
simplex bottleneck is aggressive. At K=6 you have five free dimensions. Per-gene dropout noise
*cannot be represented* in five dimensions, so it averages out across cells that share an
archetype. The model never attempts to describe gene-gene structure, which is exactly what dropout
corrupts worst. Give the residual latent room and you hand that noise a channel.

If you need it, keep `residual_dim` small and `beta_r` firm — but start with it off.

---

## 5. Two traps that fail silently

**`sample_col` swallows typos.** The AnnData branch guards with:

```python
if sample_col is not None and sample_col in adata.obs:
    resolved_samples = adata.obs[sample_col].to_numpy()
```

A misspelled column name yields `sample_ids=None` with no warning, no error, and no log line.
Downstream, that silently disables stratified splitting *and* balanced scaling — the model trains
fine and you never learn that your patient handling did nothing. Assert it landed:

```python
bundle = extract_matrix(adata=adata, source="X", sample_col="sample")
assert bundle.sample_ids is not None, "sample_col did not resolve — check adata.obs"
```

Same shape of failure for `cluster_col`.

**`marker_names` is ignored unless `source="obsm"`.** For `"X"` and `"layer"`, the argument is
accepted and then silently discarded in favour of `adata.var_names`. That is the behaviour you
want here, but it means passing `marker_names` gives you a false sense of control.

Also note: the `sample_ids` and `cluster_ids` *arguments* only apply to the DataFrame and ndarray
paths. On AnnData you must go through `sample_col` / `cluster_col`.

---

## 6. A working recipe

Adapted from `01_mcf7_probabilistic_archetype_embedding_sweep.ipynb` — the only sweep notebook

```python

adata = ad.read_h5ad("../ProbAE_Deconv/data/PDX_02_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad")
bundle = extract_matrix(adata=adata, source="X")

set_seed(GLOBAL_CFG["seed"], deterministic=GLOBAL_CFG["deterministic"])

scaler, _ = fit_scaler(bundle.X, mode="none")          # CHANGED: was "zscore"
X = preprocess_array(bundle.X, scaler)

train_idx, val_idx = split_train_val_indices(

SWEEP_GRID = {
    "model_type": ["probabilistic"],

summary_df = run_sweep(

    val_idx=val_idx,
    sample_ids=bundle.sample_ids,
    cluster_ids=bundle.cluster_ids,
    scaler_state=scaler.to_dict(),
)
```

Two non-obvious mechanics. `base_config` is the **merge** of `GLOBAL_CFG` and `BASE_TRAIN_CFG`,
not the training dict alone. And `skip_existing_runs` / `progress_sweep` are read off
`base_config` (`train.py:880-881`), not from `run_sweep` arguments — there is no keyword for them.

### On `decoder_type`: the gene embedding is not a compression

A natural question at 1,000 genes is whether to use the "gene embedding" or feed all the HVGs.
That is a false choice: **the encoder always takes all M genes**, whichever decoder you pick.
`decoder_type` only changes how the decoder reconstructs.

- `"factorized"` — `x̂ = w Z Eᵀ + b`, with `E ∈ R^{M×d}` the gene embedding (`model.py:134`)
- `"direct"` — `x̂ = w A`, with `A ∈ R^{K×M}` learned directly (`model.py:138`)

It is tempting to read the factorized form as a dimensionality reduction over genes. It isn't.
`Z @ E.T` is `(K,d) @ (d,M)`, so `A_hat` has rank ≤ min(K, d). At K=6 and d=8 that is rank ≤ 6 —
exactly what direct's `A` already spans. The parameter count runs the wrong way too:

| | parameters at M=1000, K=6, d=8 |
|---|---|
| factorized (`K·d + M·d + M`) | 48 + 8,000 + 1,000 = **9,048** |
| direct (`K·M`) | **6,000** |

Factorization only constrains anything — and only saves parameters — when `d < K`. At M=1000 and
K=6 that means `d ≤ 4`. Above that it is a reparameterisation, not a bottleneck.

**What `E` tells you, precisely.** Gene `g`'s archetype loading is `A_hat[:,g] = Z @ E_g + b_g`,
so `E_g ≈ E_h` ⟹ the two genes load alike. Closeness in `E` is real information. Two caveats in
theory: `E` is identifiable only up to an invertible `R` (`Z@R`, `E@R⁻ᵀ` reconstruct identically),
and when `d > K` the `(d−K)`-dimensional `null(Z)` contributes nothing to `x̂`, so genes can differ
there while being interchangeable to the model.

**Both caveats turn out to be inert.** Measured at 2000 HVGs against planted gene groups
(200 markers per archetype):

| readout | AUC on true gene groups | cross-seed agreement |
|---|---|---|
| `cosine_similarity_matrix(E)` | 1.000 | 0.764 |
| `cosine_similarity_matrix(A_hat.T)` | 1.000 | 0.775 |

Identical. Weight decay evidently pins the factorisation close enough to balanced that the
residual transform is near-orthogonal and cosines are effectively invariant. **Use either.**

`A_hat.T` is the marginally safer default — it is exactly the loadings, has no ambiguity even in
principle, and exists for the direct decoder too:

```python
from CyEmbed.analysis import cosine_similarity_matrix, nearest_neighbors_from_similarity

gene_sim = cosine_similarity_matrix(run["A_hat"].T)     # or run["E"] -- measured equivalent
modules = nearest_neighbors_from_similarity(gene_sim, run["marker_names"], k=8)
```

**The real caveat is neither matrix: gene modules are only ~0.77 correlated across seeds.** That
is the archetypes themselves moving between restarts, and no choice of readout fixes it. Treat any
single-seed gene module as provisional; take a consensus across seeds before believing one.

**What this does mean:** `E` gives you nothing `A_hat` doesn't, so it is **not** a reason to pick
`factorized` over `direct`.

**The reason to prefer factorized is empirical, and the mechanism is not established.** At 2000
HVGs it recovers substantially more biology: w_recovery **0.818 vs 0.575** for direct (identical
at 20 markers: 0.993 each). Both `A_hat`s are rank ≤ K, so it is not expressiveness. The likely
cause is optimisation — the d-sweep shows a wider product parametrisation trains better at
*identical rank* (0.712 at d=8 → 0.988 at d=16), and direct is single-factor and gets none of
that. Treat the 0.818-vs-0.575 gap as the reason; treat any story about why as a hypothesis.

One asymmetry to know: **the direct decoder has no bias term at all** (`self.b = None`,
`model.py:120` and `:238`). At 40 CyTOF markers that costs little. At 2000 genes it costs a lot,
and this turns out to be the second — and stronger — argument for `factorized`.

`tools/verify_sample_offset_scrna.py` simulates the real thing (NB counts → analytic Pearson
residuals → 2000 HVGs by residual variance, 6 patients, 26% median gene detection) and measures
how well each decoder recovers known cell composition:

| decoder | w_recovery @ 20 markers | w_recovery @ 2000 HVGs |
|---|---|---|
| factorized | 0.993 | **0.818** |
| direct | 0.993 | **0.575** |

Identical at CyTOF scale; a wide gap at scRNA scale. It is *not* expressiveness — both `A_hat`s
are rank ≤ K. It is the intercept: with a per-patient `B` centred to zero-sum, `direct` has no
per-gene intercept anywhere, so all K archetype rows must redundantly encode a 2000-gene baseline
instead of spending their capacity on biology. `factorized`'s `b` absorbs it for free.

So on scRNA-seq you want `factorized` twice over: for the `E` gene-module readout, and because it
measurably recovers more biology.

### Choosing `K` and `d`

These are not the same kind of choice. `K` is a hypothesis about your biology. `d` is an
optimisation setting.

**`d` first, because it's easy and you are probably in the wrong regime.** `d` sizes `Z (K,d)` and
`E (M,d)`, so `rank(A_hat) <= min(K, d)` — above `d = K` it cannot change what the model
represents. But that algebra does not predict practice. Measured at K=5, 2000 HVGs
(`tools/select_k_and_d_scrna.py`):

| d | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| w_recovery | 0.520 | 0.852 | 0.722 | 0.712 | **0.988** | 0.992 | 0.992 |

The plateau is at **d≈16–32, not at d=K**. Identical rank, hugely different results: a wider
product parametrisation is simply easier to optimise. The current sweep notebooks use
`d ∈ [4,6,8,12]` — below the knee. **Use d=16 or 32.** Sweep it once to find the plateau, then
hold it fixed while you sweep K; it does not interact with K the way you would assume.

Two things `d` does *not* do. It does not set the dimension your cells live in — `h = w @ Z` with
`w` on the simplex means cells occupy a **(K−1)-dimensional** hull regardless of `d`. And with
`decoder_type="direct"` it does nothing at all (`latent_dim` is read only in the factorized
branches, `model.py:128-129`, `:263-268`) — yet it is still fingerprinted, so sweeping `d` on a
direct decoder silently produces one run directory per value containing identical models.

**`K`: use two criteria, and distrust the fashionable one.** Against a planted `K_TRUE = 5`:

| K | val_recon | dead | stability | w_recovery (oracle) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 1.2953 | 0.0 | 1.000 | 0.490 |
| 4 | 1.3291 | 0.0 | 0.564 | 0.426 |
| **5** | **1.1920** | 0.3 | 0.740 | **0.732** |
| 6 | 1.2949 | 1.3 | 0.702 | 0.410 |
| 7 | 1.5070 | 1.0 | **1.000** | 0.029 |
| 8 | 1.2261 | 2.7 | 0.679 | 0.430 |

- **Archetype redundancy is the strongest criterion — lead with it.** `mean|off-diagonal|` of
  `cosine_similarity_matrix(A_hat)`, measured against the same planted K_TRUE=5:

  | K | 3 | 4 | **5** | 6 | 7 | 8 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | mean\|cos\| | 0.209 | 0.324 | **0.078** | **1.000** | 0.993 | 0.985 |
  | w_recovery | 0.492 | 0.500 | **0.991** | 0.020 | 0.022 | 0.029 |

  Sharp minimum at the truth, then unmistakable: **1.000 means the archetypes have become
  literally identical.** Above K_TRUE this model does not gracefully split archetypes, it
  *collapses* — almost certainly `lambda_balance` forcing uniform usage across more archetypes
  than the data supports. That also explains why cross-seed stability scores a perfect 1.000 at
  K=7: every seed collapses to the *same* degenerate solution. Use `mean`, not `max` — max hits
  1.000 at K=4 from one duplicate pair while mean is still 0.324.

- **`val_recon` minimum works** — it is *not* monotone in K, because early stopping plus the
  `lambda_*` package makes excess archetypes cost you on held-out data. Check non-monotonicity on
  your own data before trusting it; if it falls all the way to your largest K, it is not selecting.
- **Dead archetypes work** — the largest K with none picks the truth. But use a **relative**
  threshold (`usage < 0.5/K`). CyEmbed's `dead_archetypes_lt_1pct` is **absolute** (`w_bar < 0.01`),
  which gets *less* strict as K rises (0.01 is 5% of uniform at K=5 but 20% at K=20), biasing you
  toward large K.
- **Cross-seed stability fails, and fails worst where it looks best.** It picks K=7 with a perfect
  1.000 — where the model recovers essentially nothing (w_recovery 0.029) and has a dead archetype.
  A degenerate solution is trivially reproducible. **Use stability to reject a K, never to select
  one.**

**Seeds are not optional, and this dominates everything above.** Two runs of the identical config
gave `val_recon` 1.2586 and 1.3291 at K=4 — **5% run-to-run variance** from torch nondeterminism.
The winning K beat its rivals by ~6%. On a single seed you cannot distinguish signal from noise.
Nothing in the package varies seed, but you do not need a code change:

```python
SWEEP_GRID = {..., "seed": [7, 17, 23]}
```

`build_sweep_configs` is a cartesian product and `_config_fingerprint` includes `seed`, so each
lands in its own run directory. Aggregate per-K across seeds and only believe a difference larger
than the seed spread.

Finally, validate the winner biologically via the UCell join (§9). It is the only criterion here
that is not self-referential.

(One synthetic regime, K_TRUE=5, 3 seeds. Evidence, not law.)

### On `model_type`: probabilistic buys less than you'd think

The recipe above sweeps `probabilistic`, but be deliberate about why. On the scRNA-seq-scale
benchmark (`tools/verify_sample_offset_scrna.py`, 2000 HVGs, factorized decoder, measuring
recovery of known composition):

| | no regularisers | with this guide's regularisers |
|---|---|---|
| deterministic | 0.834 | **0.992** |
| probabilistic | 0.978 | 0.856 |

Read that as a 2×2, because the interaction is the whole story: **the KL and the explicit
regularisers are substitutes, not complements.** Without `lambda_*`, the probabilistic model's KL
does the regularising and helps a lot (0.834 → 0.978). With `lambda_*` already in place, adding
the KL over-regularises and *costs* you accuracy (0.992 → 0.856). The best configuration here is
**deterministic + the regularisers**.

So the reason to choose `probabilistic` is not accuracy. It is the one thing the deterministic
model cannot give you: a per-cell posterior (`mu_w`, `logvar_w`), so a shallow or ambiguous cell
can report that its composition is uncertain instead of returning a confident point estimate. That
is genuinely valuable on scRNA-seq, where depth varies enormously between cells.

But note that `prob_eval_mode="mean"` — the default, and what the real mcf7 analysis notebook
uses — takes the posterior mean and discards the uncertainty. If that is your workflow, you are
paying seven extra hyperparameters (`beta_w`, `beta_r`, `kl_warmup_epochs`, `logvar_min/max`,
`logvar_init_bias`, `prob_eval_*`) and some accuracy for something you then throw away. Use
`probabilistic` when you will act on `logvar_w`; otherwise prefer `deterministic`.

(Two seeds, one synthetic regime — evidence, not law. Sweep both on your own data.)

### On `recon_loss_type`

`"huber"` is available and would genuinely help: Pearson residuals have heavy tails, and Huber
downweights them. Use it if you are running CyEmbed on its own. **Do not use it if you are
comparing against mcRBM**, whose loss is hardcoded MSE (`../mcRBM/cytof_mcrbm/losses.py:44`) with
no robustness knob — the comparison would be unfair by construction.

---

## 7. Multi-patient work

**Your h5ads are single-sample.** `BCK_44_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad` and
`PDX_02_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad` each contain one sample; identity lives in the *filename*,
driven by `sample:` in `sct_gaussian_k_sweep.yaml`. `.obs` has only `cell_id`. Nothing in the
current pipeline concatenates them.

So before any of this applies, you need a combined object with a real sample column:

```python
import anndata as ad
a = ad.read_h5ad(".../BCK_44_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad")
b = ad.read_h5ad(".../PDX_02_sct_pearson_residuals_hvg.h5ad")
a.obs["sample"] = "BCK_44"
b.obs["sample"] = "PDX_02"
combined = ad.concat([a, b], join="inner")   # inner join: HVG sets differ per sample
```

`join="inner"` matters — HVGs are selected per sample, so the gene sets are not identical. An
outer join would fabricate residuals for genes never modelled in one sample.

Then:

```python
bundle = extract_matrix(adata=combined, source="X", sample_col="sample")
assert bundle.sample_ids is not None

train_idx, val_idx = split_train_val_indices(
    n_cells=bundle.X.shape[0], val_fraction=0.2, seed=7,
    stratify_labels=bundle.sample_ids,     # every patient lands in BOTH halves
)
```

That stratification is important and CyEmbed gets it right: `split_train_val_indices` splits
*within* each group (`data.py:255-260`), so every patient contributes cells to train and val.
(mcRBM's equivalent does not — see its guide.)

### The per-patient offset

`use_sample_offset=True` gives the decoder a learned per-patient intercept `B ∈ R^{S×M}`, so
`x̂ = wZEᵀ + b + B[s]`. Archetypes then model deviation from *that patient's own baseline*, and
additive patient effects cannot leak into the weights because the decoder explains them for free.

```python
SWEEP_GRID = {..., "use_sample_offset": [True]}
```

Verified for **both** decoders on planted-shift synthetic data (`tools/verify_sample_offset.py`,
8 patients × 3 seeds, paired arms). With the offset on, cross-patient spread collapses
(0.21 → 0.02 factorized, 0.28 → 0.02 direct), `B` recovers the planted shift at corr 1.000, and —
the check that matters — `w_recovery` rises from ~0.15 to ~0.99, meaning `W` *keeps the biology*
rather than merely losing its patient structure. So you can use `factorized` and get both gene
modules and patient correction.

Three things to know:

- It removes **additive** shifts only, not multiplicative or interaction effects.
- It is a **soft** fix. It removes the *incentive* for the weights to encode patient identity; it
  does not forbid it. The encoder still sees raw expression — deliberately, so you can still
  project an unseen patient in one forward pass (they decode at `B = 0`, the average baseline).
- `A_hat` does **not** include `B`. It remains the archetype profile at the average patient.
  Inspect `B.npy` separately.

**Do not reach for it reflexively.** In PDX and patient tumours, inter-patient variation
substantially *is* the biology — different tumours, different genotypes. Shared archetypes with
patient-varying composition is the *goal*, not the failure. Train with the offset off first and
look at what you get. The failure worth correcting is narrow and specific: an archetype with
`dominant_fraction ≈ 1.0` in one patient and ≈ 0 elsewhere. Graded usage differences across
patients are your result, and correcting them deletes it.

If patient and batch are perfectly confounded (each patient its own run), nothing separates them
and the offset removes both.

### Alternative: correct upstream with SCTransform's `batch_var`

`B` is not the only place to put the correction. `sctransform::vst` takes a `batch_var`, and its
documentation states the mechanism precisely:

> **no batch interaction terms used if omitted**

**Interaction terms are the point.** With `batch_var`, batch is crossed with `latent_var`
(default `log_umi`), so every batch gets **its own depth slope** — not merely its own intercept.
`B` is intercept-only: one additive vector per sample, no depth term at all.

That gap is not hypothetical on shallow data. On BCK_44 (766-median library) an archetype tracked
library size at −0.300 on the analytic route. If samples differ in chemistry, depth, or
saturation, the depth–expression *relationship* differs between them, and `B` cannot represent
that however well it is fit.

`batch_var` also fixes comparability: one global `theta` regularization across all cells, so
residuals mean the same thing in every sample. Per-sample SCTransform gives exactly that up —
and note that **the existing per-sample `.h5ad` files already half-correct by construction**,
since each file's residuals are centred against its own NB fit. Concatenating those and then
enabling `B` leaves `B` with very little to absorb.

| | CyEmbed `use_sample_offset` | SCTransform `batch_var` | Seurat `vars.to.regress` |
|---|---|---|---|
| where | decoder intercept, residual space | inside the NB GLM, count space | post-hoc on residuals |
| batch × depth interaction | **no** | **yes** | no |
| reversible / A-B testable | **yes** (config flag) | no (baked into the matrix) | no |
| cross-sample `theta` comparability | n/a | **yes** | yes |

**Choosing.** They are near-redundant — pick one, do not stack them, or you double-correct and
cannot attribute the result.

- Samples differ in protocol, chemistry, or depth profile → **`batch_var`**, and you then do not
  need `B`.
- Same protocol, additive shifts only → **`B`**, which is cheaper and lets you measure whether
  the correction changed anything.
- Prefer `batch_var` over `vars.to.regress` in either case: the latter regresses on residuals
  post-hoc, while `batch_var` models the effect at the count level where it lives.

**Neither solves the composition problem.** Both absorb per-sample per-gene means, and a
patient's mean residual is roughly `α_patient · Z Eᵀ` — their archetype composition. So both will
eat between-patient composition differences and push `W` toward within-patient-centred. If
"does patient A use program 3 more than patient B" is your endpoint, that is the signal being
removed. This is structural reasoning, not a measurement, and note that
`tools/verify_sample_offset.py` **does not test it**: it plants a technical shift independent of
composition, so `w_recovery → 0.99` establishes only that `B` preserves biology when the shift is
*not* confounded with composition — which is not the usual case in a patient cohort.

**Caution on `batch_var`:** its documentation is a single line and it is far less exercised than
the rest of `sctransform`. Validate it on your data rather than trusting it — the depth-vs-usage
correlation in §8 is the direct test, and it already caught one artifact.

## 8. Reading the output

Residual space changes what the archetypes mean.

`A_hat` is the archetype profile in feature space (`Z @ E.T + b` for the factorized decoder,
`model.py:135`). On CyTOF you read it as expression intensity. On Pearson residuals, read it as
**enrichment relative to depth expectation**: a positive loading means "this gene appears more
than sequencing depth alone predicts in cells using this archetype."

Negative loadings are therefore meaningful, not a modelling artifact — they are genuine depletion.
This is the one place where CyEmbed's signed loadings are an advantage over NMF, whose
non-negativity cannot express depletion at all.

```python
from CyEmbed.analysis import load_run_outputs, archetype_marker_rankings, summarize_by_group

run = load_run_outputs(best_run_dir)
W = run.get("W_mean", run.get("W"))
ranking = archetype_marker_rankings(run["A_hat"], marker_names=run["marker_names"], top_n=12)
```

`load_run_outputs` (`analysis.py:12`) loads every `*.npy` in the run directory keyed by filename
stem, so `W`, `A_hat`, `mu_w`, `Z`, `E`, `b` all appear depending on model type. Prefer `W_mean`
over `W` for probabilistic runs — it is the posterior mean and is more stable than a single
sample.

---

## 9. Validating without labels

`label_column: null` throughout your pipeline, and `.obs` carries only `cell_id`. There are no
cell-type annotations to score against, so ARI/NMI against ground truth is not available.

The established alternative here is **UCell signature correlation**, from notebook 301's Figure 12:
join signature scores on `cell_id`, then Spearman-correlate each signature against each archetype
weight.

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

ucell = pd.read_csv(".../PDX_02.RNA.UCell.Tumor.csv")
if "barcode" in ucell.columns:
    ucell = ucell.rename(columns={"barcode": "cell_id"})
ucell["cell_id"] = ucell["cell_id"].astype(str)

weights = pd.DataFrame(W, columns=[f"w_{k}" for k in range(W.shape[1])])
weights["cell_id"] = run["cell_ids"]
merged = weights.merge(ucell, on="cell_id", how="inner")
```

`cell_id` is the sole join key to any external annotation, carried in-band precisely so labels can
stay out of the modelling path. Upstream cluster annotations do exist (e.g.
`BCK_44.RNA.leiden_sct_94.csv`, `BCK_44.cluster_annotations_auto_from_hallmark.csv`) and can be
joined the same way if you want a harder check.

---

## 10. Diagnostics you should run every time

**Depth leakage.** The single cheapest and most informative check. If archetype weights correlate
with sequencing depth, your preprocessing failed and everything downstream is suspect:

```python
depth = np.asarray(adata.X.sum(axis=1)).ravel()   # or n_genes detected
for k in range(W.shape[1]):
    r, _ = spearmanr(W[:, k], depth)
    print(f"archetype {k}: rho vs depth = {r:+.3f}")
```

Note this needs a depth covariate, which the SCT residual h5ad does not carry — `.obs` has only
`cell_id`. Compute it from the NB-route h5ad (`bck44_scrna_hvg_counts.h5ad` has `total_counts`)
and join on `cell_id`.

**Patient leakage.**

```python
stats = summarize_by_group(W, sample_ids, group_name="sample")
# stats["dominant_fractions"] -> look for any archetype ~1.0 in one patient, ~0 elsewhere
```

**Stability.** Your existing sweep runs `seeds: [42]` — one seed. Archetypal autoencoders are
non-convex and seed-sensitive, and `val_recon` measures fit, not reproducibility. Run several
seeds at your chosen K and check archetype agreement across restarts (cosine similarity between
`A_hat` matrices, matched greedily). This is the one methodological gap where cNMF's consensus
procedure has an answer and CyEmbed currently does not.

---

## 11. The alternative worth knowing about

Pearson residuals are a workaround: you transform the data until MSE stops being wrong. The more
principled route models counts directly with a negative-binomial likelihood — no transform at all.

**You already have this.** `../ProbAE_Deconv/configs/bck44_scrna_nb_k_sweep.yaml` runs an
archetypal autoencoder with `decoder_family: "nb"`, `loss: {type: nb_nll}`,
`data: {encoder_input: log1p_normalized, decoder_target: raw_counts}`, and
`use_observed_library_size: true`. It reads a counts h5ad (`bck44_scrna_hvg_counts.h5ad`,
sparse CSR, with a full scanpy QC block: mito/ribo caps, doublet scoring).

If you are choosing between them: NB-on-counts is more defensible and a reviewer will prefer it.
Residuals-plus-CyEmbed is what lets you use *this* package, and is required if you want a
controlled comparison against mcRBM (which cannot do NB). Running both and comparing is the honest
move — if NB clearly wins, the transform is costing you signal.

## 12. A note on scale

PDX_02 is 5,774 cells × 1,000 genes. BCK_44 is **330 cells** × 1,000 genes.

At 330 cells, an encoder of `[256, 64]` over 1,000 inputs has ~272,000 parameters fit to 330
observations. The simplex bottleneck is the only reason this is not hopeless — it forces every
cell onto a K−1 dimensional object regardless of how expressive the encoder is, and that
constraint, not the data, is what regularises the fit. It works, but treat BCK_44 results as
provisional and prefer PDX_02 for anything you intend to defend.

This matters much more for mcRBM, which estimates second-order structure and needs
cells ≫ genes. See its guide.
